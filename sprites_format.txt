The `.sprites` extension denotes a sprites mapping file, and is a rather plain
and simple CSV-style format.

In general, most lines will consist of mappings of sprite filenames to their
`(x1, y1, x2, y2)` offsets into the actual map. For example::

    a.png,0,0,12,24
    b.png,12,0,48,36
    c.png,0,24,10,34

Above is a mapping of three images, with x1 being the second column, and so on.

The other type of line are attribute lines. These describe metadata
essentially, and look like this::

    __foo__,value1
    __bar__,value2

Only one metadata item is so far defined and used, and that's `url`. It defines
where the image map may be reached from the end CSS file. Its use should be
obvious, as the sprite mapping routines need to know where to point the
background URL.
